# Push up counter

This is my first project using flutter

## Getting Started

when you open the app the first thing you have to do is clicking start, then position the phone at the height that you prefer, you can use a book or other object to help you. the when doing push ups use your nose to touch the blue zone in your screen, when you release it it will count as on push up
